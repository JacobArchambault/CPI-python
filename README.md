This Jupyter Notebook provides a series of results and data visualizations for the Consumer Price Index (CPI), an index that tracks the price of a variety of consumer goods from 1947 to present. The Notebook was originally developed as part of a Code Louisville course on Data Science with Python and SQL to display competence with these technologies, and answers a number of questions concerning the absolute and relative changes in the CPI over time In this notebook, I 
1) Display the data for the index as a whole;
2) Rename its columns to increase readability;
3) Retrieve the months with the five highest and lowest CPIs on record;
4) Display line charts for i) the index as a whole and ii) select years surrounding the housing crisis of the late 2000s
5) Find the peak CPI during that crisis
6) Calculate and graph the minimum, average, and maximum CPI values for each calendar year.
7) Determine when CPI exhibited the greatest variation in a given calendar year. I show that in both absolute terms and relative terms, the greatest variation in CPI over a year is found in the late 1970s, with the percent increase of the maximum CPI over the minimum peaking in 1979 and the absolute difference between these being the same for 1979 and 1980. While this absolute difference is nearly matched during housing bubble of the late 2000s, with prices peaking in 2007, the variation in prices found in the late 2000s was not as great in relative terms, since asset prices were considerably higher during the entirety of the 2000s crisis than they were at any point during the stagflation of the late 70s.
